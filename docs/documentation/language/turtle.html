          What is a "turtle"
        </a>
      </h1>
    <p>In Malloy, an object which has a name and transforms a shape
is called a "turtle". The word comes from the philosophical phrase
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down">Turtles All The Way Down</a>.</p>
<p>An example of a turtle might look like this</p>
<pre class="language-malloy">   group_by_size <span class="token keyword">is</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">reduce</span>
    size
    object_count
   <span class="token punctuation">)</span></pre><p>This "turtle" could then be used to build out other computations,
for example</p>
<pre class="language-malloy">  sizes_in_ca <span class="token keyword">is</span> group_by_size <span class="token punctuation">[</span> state : <span class="token string">'CA'</span> <span class="token punctuation">]</span></pre><p>This is an unusual word, and it may be replaced once we figure out a better word
but right now, you will see the word "turtle" from time to time, and this
is what it means.</p>
